# Protocol Summary

A smart contract application for storing a password. Users should be able to store a password and then retrieve it later. Others should not be able to access the password.



# Disclaimer

The Ricardo Mazuera team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.

# Findings
## High
### [H-1] On-chain passwords are visible to everyone, regardless of Solidity variable visibility.

**Description:** All data stored on-chain is visible to anyone, and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be a private variable, and only accessed through the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, which is intended to be only called by the owner of the contract. 

However, anyone can direclty read this using any number of off chain methodologies

**Impact:** The password is not private. 

**Proof of Concept:** The below test case shows how anyone could read the password directly from the blockchain. We use [foundry's cast](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tool to read directly from the storage of the contract, without being the owner. 

1. Create a locally running chain
```bash
make anvil
```

2. Deploy the contract to the chain

```
make deploy 
```

3. Run the storage tool

We use `1` because that's the storage slot of `s_password` in the contract.

```
cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

You'll get an output that looks like this:

`0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

You can then parse that hex to a string with:

```
cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```

And get an output of:

```
myPassword
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could encrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain. This would require the user to remember another password off-chain to decrypt the password. However, you'd also likely want to remove the view function as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send a transaction with the password that decrypts your password. 


### [H-2] `PasswordStore::setPassword` is callable by anyone 

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be an `external` function, however the natspec of the function and overall purpose of the smart contract is that `This function allows only the owner to set a new password.`

```javascript
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>      // @audit - There are no access controls here
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract.

**Proof of Concept:** 

Add the following to the `PasswordStore.t.sol` test suite.

```javascript
function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
    vm.prank(randomAddress);
    string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
    passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);
    vm.prank(owner);
    string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
    assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control modifier to the `setPassword` function. 

```javascript
if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```
